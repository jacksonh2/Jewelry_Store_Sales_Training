# Jewery_Store_Sales_Training

The data of this project is provided by a Kays Jewelers, a Jewery Retail chain.
Back in 2012, the company offered 3 voluntary training modules to its employees (salesperson & store manager) aimed to improve employees’ sales & return performance.

In 2013, the company further improved the training program and introduced 5 new additional modules related to product knowledge and service and selling skills，

As Business analysts working on this project, we will use the data (2011-13) for following:

  * To quantify the impact of the training programs

  * To assess the change in impact owing to the service years and other parameter for the salespeople

  * To understand the effect of offering additional training modules
